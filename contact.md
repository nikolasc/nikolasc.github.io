## If You Really Must
This blog is part of the [Rapi.ca](http://rapi.ca) website, a work-in-process by Nikolas C., who is solely responsible for its content. So be sure to send him (I mean me) an email if something posted here offends you or some content you own has been published by mistake (without the proper accreditation).

Nikolas can be reached at his email address on [Coperni.ca](http://coperni.ca). if you cannot figure it out, I guess that's one less spam...I mean email... for me to read.
